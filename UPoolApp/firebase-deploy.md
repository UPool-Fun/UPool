# Firebase Security Rules Deployment Guide

## Quick Fix - Deploy Security Rules

Your Firebase database is in production mode with restrictive default rules. Follow these steps to deploy the security rules:

### 1. Install Firebase CLI (if not already installed)
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### 2. Login to Firebase
```bash
firebase login
```

### 3. Initialize Firebase in your project (if not done)
```bash
cd /Users/osx/Projects/UPoolFun/UPool/UPoolApp
firebase init firestore --project upool-4a590
```
- Select "Use an existing project" 
- Choose "upool-4a590"
- Accept default firestore.rules file
- Don't overwrite existing files

### 4. Deploy the security rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules --project upool-4a590
```

### 5. Verify deployment
```bash
firebase firestore:rules --project upool-4a590
```

## Security Rules Explanation

The rules allow:
- ✅ **Pool Creation**: Anyone can create pools with valid wallet addresses
- ✅ **Draft Pools**: Creators can save and update their draft pools
- ✅ **Public Pools**: Anyone can read public pools
- ✅ **Creator Access**: Pool creators can read/update their own pools
- ✅ **Base Pay Integration**: Supports payment tracking and status updates

### Authentication Strategy
The rules support your dual authentication system:
- **Browser Users**: Authenticated with Privy wallet addresses (`0x...`)
- **Farcaster Users**: Authenticated with Farcaster IDs (`farcaster:12345`)

### Security Features
- Validates wallet address formats (Ethereum: `0x...` + Farcaster: `farcaster:...`)
- Prevents unauthorized pool modifications
- Ensures required fields are present
- Supports payment processing status updates

## Testing the Rules

After deployment, test the create flow:
1. Go to `/create`
2. Try creating a pool
3. Check if auto-save works
4. Verify no more "insufficient permissions" errors

## Alternative: Quick Test Mode (NOT for production)

If you need immediate testing, you can temporarily use test mode rules:
```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```
⚠️ **WARNING**: This allows anyone to read/write all data. Only use for testing!

## Production Deployment

For production, use the secure rules in `firestore.rules` which properly validate:
- User authentication
- Data validation  
- Access control
- Required fields
