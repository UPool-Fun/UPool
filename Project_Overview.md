## üìò Overview

UPool is a social, trust-based platform that allows friends, communities, and travelers to pool money toward shared goals, grow funds using Morpho lending protocol on the Base blockchain, and unlock funds based on milestone validation and voting. Each pool has its own smart wallet address with custom vanity names (e.g., upool.fun/p/skytrip), supports social login authentication, and enables users to donate, invest, or contribute NFTs through integrated auction systems.

Built as a native Farcaster Mini App using Minikit, UPool leverages the Farcaster social graph for trust-based pool discovery, viral sharing through Frames, and seamless wallet interactions within the Farcaster ecosystem.
